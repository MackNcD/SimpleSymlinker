# SimpleSymlinker
Automated Symlinking. No bells, no whistles, just function for this one; it's fantastic for saving massive amounts of space, but not needed more than a rare occasion when organizing AI models through out seperate UIs and such.

Click the .bat or shortcut depending on what works for your system, and then click the only button in the UI. That will bring up a file open window. Grab as many files as you need. Shift + click for many in a row, ctrl + click to select any not in a row. Click the only button in the UI. Another file open window will pop up. This is for directories. Choose your file you want to link your files to.

This does softlinks. If you need hardlinks the script is like 8 lines long you could probably just change the word 'soft' to 'hard' though I don't use hardlinks/not needed for models, but do as thy will.

There aren't any dependancies, so no .venv for this one, it's the smallest program I think that exists on github.
